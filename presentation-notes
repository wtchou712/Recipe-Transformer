parse recipe:

-use specific class and id tags in the html to get
	-servings
	-ingredient amount
	-ingredient name
	-directions

	"4 tablespoons"

-if we split "ingredient amount" into an array of words
	-first is the quantity = 4
	-rest is measurement = tablespoons

for tools: 
-we have a text file with list of tools
-if any in the directions, we push the tool to an array
-remove duplicates

similar things for cooking methods and primary cooking methods

for primary cooking methods, we get the most common

**NOTE**
-even though directions not exactly how she wants it, we still have directions in parsed recipe
-also have servings


TRANSFORMING THE RECIPE: 

-everything except bake to stir fry

-take the parsed recipe
-go through the names of ingredients
-if they are in our knowledge base dictionary of replacements
-then we replace the ingredient name
-the only quantity change we make is if, its in units, so we say 1 unit is a quarter pound
-then we go through the direcitons and change the ingredients used

BAKE TO STIR FRY

-we convert the baking temperatures in the directions form degrees to low->high
-we also replace the tools with cooking toosl you would use with stir-frying
	-i.e. oven -> stovetop
	-baking pan -> frying pan
-we add 2 tablesppons of oil for the ingredients because we add direction to get a pan and add oil
-ex: "preheat oven" -> "place pan on stove and set to specific heat"
-also change time, divide by 5
-replace cooking methods and primary cooking method
