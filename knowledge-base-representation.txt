Transforming to vegetarian/vegan/pescatarian/lactose-free options: 
1. Store a list of ingredients or a 1-to-1 ingredient of replacements for ingredients as well how it is prepared. For example, chicken -> tofu, beef -> mushrooms, milk -> almond milk
2. Look through the ingredients of recipe we want to transform. 
3. If we find an ingredient that does not follow the rule of the option desired, we will replace that with the assigned replacement that is in our knowledge base. For example, 
if we find chicken, we'll change it to tofu, and change the preparation for that ingredient as well. 

Transforming cooking method: 
1. Store a database of cooking methods as well as preparation and tools 
2. Look through the recipe that we want to transform
3. Replace the old tool used to the new tool used (spatula -> tongs)
4. Replace the cooking device (oven -> grill)
5. Replace the units of cooking (300 degrees -> medium-high heat)
6. Replace the preparation (preheating oven -> preheating a pot of water)

Transforming to healthier alternatives: 
1. Store a database of healthier alternatives for an ingredient depending on the type of alternative. For example, in low carb we store a relation from rice to quinoa or for low fat whole milk to skim milk or butter to olive oil
2. Store a database of which ingredients should be changed 
3. Look through the ingredients and replace the ingredient that should be changed based on the alternative to transform to.
